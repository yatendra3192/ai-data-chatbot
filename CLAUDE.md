## Overview
An intelligent data analysis chatbot application that uses OpenAI's GPT models to dynamically analyze data from SQLite database and generate multiple visualizations. The app features a purple gradient chat interface with real-time data analysis capabilities on 1.4+ million rows of CRM data.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript (served by backend in production)
- **Database**: SQLite (465MB database with 1.4M+ rows)
- **AI Model**: GPT-4-turbo (with GPT-3.5 fallback)
- **Data Processing**: SQL queries via SQLite
- **Visualizations**: Recharts (dynamic charts)
- **Deployment**: Railway Cloud Platform (automatic CI/CD from GitHub)

## Key Features
1. **Intelligent Query Processing**: Uses LLM to dynamically generate SQL queries based on natural language
2. **Database-Powered Analysis**: SQLite database with 1.4M+ rows for instant queries
3. **LLM-Driven Multiple Chart Generation**: GPT-4 intelligently determines appropriate chart types
4. **Dynamic Recommendations**: Data-driven insights based on actual query results
5. **Real-time Streaming**: Uses SSE for smooth response streaming
6. **Performance**: Sub-second query response times on large datasets

## Database Details
- **SQLite Database**: `backend/database/crm_analytics.db` (465MB)
- **Tables**:
  - `salesorder`: 60,481 rows
  - `quote`: 141,461 rows
  - `quotedetail`: 1,237,446 rows
- **Total**: 1,439,388 rows

## Performance Metrics
- Query speed: 0.023-0.885 seconds (most under 0.1s)

   - **Solution**: Move app to /railway directory in Dockerfile
   - **Status**: FIXED in current deployment

2. **Frontend not displaying data**
   - **Issue**: Streaming response shows type: 'complete' but frontend checks status: 'complete'
   - **Solution**: Update useDataAnalysis.ts to check data.type === 'complete'
   - **File**: frontend/lib/hooks/useDataAnalysis.ts:48
   - **Status**: FIXED

3. **Database not found in production**
   - **Issue**: Database path differs between local and Railway
   - **Solution**: Check for /railway directory existence in main_unified.py
   - **Status**: FIXED with path detection logic

4. **API endpoints 404**
   - **Issue**: Frontend calling wrong endpoint
   - **Solution**: Ensure frontend uses /api/analyze in production
   - **Status**: FIXED
