# Railway Volume Mount Issue

## The Problem
Railway's volume mount at `/app/backend/database` is causing container startup failures with the error:
```
Container failed to start
The volume is mounted to a directory that is overriding the container's entrypoint.
```

## Temporary Solution

### Option 1: Remove the Volume (Recommended for Now)
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Navigate to Settings → Volumes
3. **Unmount or delete the volume**
4. Redeploy

This will:
- Allow the app to start successfully
- Use ephemeral storage (data resets on redeploy)
- But at least the app will work!

### Option 2: Use External Database
Instead of SQLite with volume, use:
1. **Railway PostgreSQL** - Add as a service
2. **Supabase** - Free PostgreSQL hosting
3. **Neon** - Serverless PostgreSQL

## What We Tried (All Failed)
1. ✗ Setting WORKDIR to `/app/backend` 
2. ✗ Setting WORKDIR to `/app`
3. ✗ Moving entire app to `/railway`
4. ✗ Creating symlinks
5. ✗ Copying files in different orders

## The Root Cause
Railway's volume mount system appears to have a bug where mounting to `/app/backend/database` interferes with the container's ability to start when the backend code is also in a related path.

## Permanent Solutions

### Solution 1: External Database (Best)
- Migrate to PostgreSQL
- Use Railway's PostgreSQL service
- No volume mount needed

### Solution 2: Different Storage Pattern
- Store database in a completely different location like `/data`
- Requires Railway to allow changing mount path

### Solution 3: Wait for Railway Fix
- This appears to be a Railway platform issue
- Report to Railway support

## For Now
**Remove the volume** and let the app work with ephemeral storage. Your app will function perfectly, just the database will reset on each deployment.
