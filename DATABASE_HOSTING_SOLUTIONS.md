# Database Hosting Solutions for Railway

## ⚠️ Current Issue
Google Drive blocks direct downloads for large files (>100MB) without user confirmation, which doesn't work in automated deployments.

## ✅ Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Dropbox (Easiest)
1. Upload `crm_analytics.db` to Dropbox
2. Get the sharing link
3. **Important**: Change `?dl=0` to `?raw=1` at the end
   - Original: `https://www.dropbox.com/s/abc123/crm_analytics.db?dl=0`
   - Modified: `https://www.dropbox.com/s/abc123/crm_analytics.db?raw=1`
4. Use this as your `DATABASE_URL` in Railway

### Option 2: Use GitHub Releases
1. Go to: https://github.com/yatendra3192/ai-data-chatbot/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Upload your `crm_analytics.db` file as an asset
4. Publish the release
5. Right-click the database file → Copy link address
6. Use this URL as `DATABASE_URL`

### Option 3: Use WeTransfer
1. Go to https://wetransfer.com/
2. Upload your database file
3. Get the direct download link
4. Use as `DATABASE_URL` (Note: Links expire after 7 days)

### Option 4: Use File.io (Temporary)
1. Upload to https://file.io/
2. Get the direct download URL
3. Use as `DATABASE_URL` (Note: File deleted after first download)

### Option 5: Use AWS S3
1. Upload to S3 bucket
2. Make the file public or generate a presigned URL
3. Use the S3 URL as `DATABASE_URL`

## 🚀 Quick Fix for Now

Since you already have the volume attached, you can:

1. **Remove the current DATABASE_URL** from Railway variables (it's not working with Google Drive)

2. **Let the app use the sample database** (13,000 records) which will work immediately

3. **Or upload your database to Dropbox/GitHub** and update the DATABASE_URL

## Manual Upload Option (Advanced)

If you have Railway CLI installed locally:

```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run a shell in your deployment
railway run bash

# Download database directly in the container
cd /app/backend/database
wget -O crm_analytics.db "YOUR_DIRECT_DOWNLOAD_URL"

# Or use curl
curl -L -o crm_analytics.db "YOUR_DIRECT_DOWNLOAD_URL"
```

## Testing Your Database

Once properly loaded, test with:
- "How many sales orders are there?" (Should be 60,481 for full DB or 1,000 for sample)
- "Total number of quote details?" (Should be 1,237,446 for full DB or 10,000 for sample)
